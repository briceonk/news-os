# Sony NEWS NWS-5000X

The NWS-5000X is a MIPS R4400-based workstation released in June 1994. It is
an APbus based system (meaning that it uses APbus expansion cards). Mine came
with an APbus video card included, the Sony DSC-39, which has an analog video
output with a 13W3 connector. The 5000X has four additional APbus slots.

## NWS-5000X key info
The June 1994 issue of UNIX Magazine has an article about the release of the 5000X and its server equivalent, the 5900X.
Both systems shipped with NEWS-OS 6.0 (although they can still boot 4.2.1RD, without support for certain devices like the new framebuffer cards, the XB, XBturbo, and XB24).

## Booting an NWS-5000X
The 5000X's boot parameters are controlled via DIP switches on the front of the
unit and parameters set in the battery-backed parameter RAM. See
[5000X DIP settings](http://ozuma.o.oo7.jp/unix/news/dip.htm) for a full list.
- DIP Switch 1
  - OFF = Use serial port 0 as the console (9600-8-N-1)
  - ON = Use the xa/xb interface (13W3 monitor) and keyboard as a VT-100 emulator
- DIP Switch 4
  - OFF = Normal operation
  - ON = Force parameter RAM clear on next boot
- DIP Switch 5 (If the security lockout is set to 1, this is considered ON regardless of the switch position)
  - OFF = Boot into ROM monitor
  - ON = Auto-boot into operating system.

## Using the NWS-5000X ROM monitor
ozuma has a fantastic guide to most of the [ROM monitor commands](http://ozuma.o.oo7.jp/unix/news/command.htm).
There are also some hidden commands (unlisted in main help text). These are marked as such below. In the monitor ROM,
the hidden commands are those whose title starts with an `*`.

### bo - Boot operating system
The `bo` command tells the ROM monitor to boot the system with the specified SCSI
address and partition. Running `bo` alone is equivalent to running `bo scsi(0,0,0)`.

SCSI devices are specified as `scsi(bus, ID * 10[,partition])`, so, for example,
booting from a second hard drive on ID 2 would be done by running `bo scsi(0,20)`.
The 5000X has two SCSI buses. All internal devices are on bus 0, but external
devices can be attached to either bus.

Finally, `bo` supports the `-s`, `-a`, and `-x` flags. `-s` will boot into single-user
mode. `-a` will cause the ROM monitor to prompt the user for the kernel path. The
default path is set by the bootloader, and is usually `/vmunix` for NEWS-OS 4.x,
and `/stand/unix` for 5.x and later. `-x` will load the bootloader into memory
but will not execute it. The bootloader is loaded at physical address 0x80001000.

```

```

### cls - Clear screen

### date - Set or show date and time

### dd - Copy device

### diag - Run diagnostic test

### dis - Disassemble memory

### dl - Display disk label
`dl` will display the BSD disklabel for the specified SCSI address.

### ej - Eject removable medium

### = - Evaluate numeric expression

### fc - Flush cache [Hidden]

### format - Format medium

### go - Run user program in memory [Hidden]

### he - ROM Monitor Help
`he` prints the built-in command listing with brief usage descriptions. Also provides more detailed help of each
instruction. Hidden commands will not be listed when running `he` alone, but the extended help message will still be
printed if a hidden command is passed in.
```
> he md

md [ -{b|h|w} ] [ <begin> [ <end> ]]

Display contents of memory, from <begin> through <end>. If <end> is omitted,
256 bytes from <begin> is listed. If both <begin> and <end> is is omitted,
dis lists 256 bytes from the current address pointer, and waits for key-input
with prompt message "MORE".

To abort listing press [q] key. To list next page, press [RETURN] or [SPACE].
And [-] key returns you to previous page.

Where -b, -h and -w flags specifies size of display unit, byte, half word or
word.
```

Running `he` with the `-a` flag will list all commands, even the hidden ones.

### ms - Substitute memory

### mt - Test memory [Hidden]

### mx - Scan memory

### off - Power off the system
Does what it says on the tin.

### ra - Get IP address via RARP
This will cause the NWS-5000X to broadcast its MAC address using RARP to get
an IP address. Requires a RARP server on the network to respond.
```
> ra
192.168.2.75
```

### rc - Reconfigure devices

### rx - Change radix

### set - Set or change a variable in parameter RAM
The NWS-5000X has [parameters](http://ozuma.o.oo7.jp/unix/news/rom.htm) that can
be set in battery-backed RAM, including the input device, output device, default
boot disk (used by DIP Switch 5/Security Lockout 1).
Running `set` alone will display the current values. The syntax for changing
variables is `set <variable_name>=<value>`, or simply `set <variable_name>`

```
> set
network=ethernet
bootdev=scsi(0,0)
machine=news5000
cputype=r4000
model=NWS-5000
mon=2
```

### sl - Attach AP-Bus controller [Hidden]

### ss - Show system status

### term - Terminal emulator

### unset - Remove parameter RAM variable

### vers - Show firmware version

## Using a SCSI2SDv6 with the NWS-5000X
Like most SCSI-based computers, the NWS-5000X can use a SCSI2SD in addition to
or in place of hard drives and CD-ROM drives. In general, widely available
SCSI2SD guides are applicable to the 5000X. The following setup worked for me
and was able to boot into both NEWS-OS 4.2.1aR and NEWS-OS 6.1.2. For some
reason (some string format difference between the real drive and the SCSI2SD?),
6.1.2 would kernel panic on boot with the vendor string left-aligned.
6.1.2 still complains about the drive being unknown when the vendor is
right-aligned, but it fixes the kernel panic.
- Vendor: " SEAGATE"
- Product ID: "ST12550N"

## Replacing the RTC chip
The NWS-5000X, thankfully, has a socketed battery-backed RTC and NVRAM chip. The chip is an STMicro `M48T02-150PC1` and
can be ordered from [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/M48T02-150PC1/497-2825-5-ND/606249).

## Making a custom video cable
The NWS-5000X video card uses a standard 13W3 connector, but it has an extremely unusual pinout. If you have a
sync-on-green monitor, the below cable will work (the NWS-5000X should auto-detect this configuration, but `crttype`
can be set in the ROM monitor to force the output on if it doesn't).
```
  13W3 <--> VGA
A1 (G) <--> 2 (G)         
A2 (B) <--> 3 (B)
A3 (R) <--> 1 (R)
```
The shield and ground cables should also be connected. For a full pinout, including the ID pins, see 
[NEWS World's monitor page](https://web.archive.org/web/20160419000932/http://www.videa.or.jp/NEWS/nws50-13w3-2.html).
