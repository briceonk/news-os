# What is NEWS?
Sony developed a line of Unix-based workstations in the late 1980s through the
mid 1990s called NEWS (Net Work Station). The late 80s workstations were powered
by Motorola 68k series processors, whereas the 90s-era workstations were powered
by MIPS R3k and R4k processors.

# Supported operating systems
NEWS workstations can run two operating systems: NEWS-OS and NetBSD. NEWS-OS was
Sony's proprietary Unix operating system. NEWS-OS 4.x and earlier are based on
BSD. NEWS-OS 5.x and later are based on System V Release 4 / SVR4 Unix.
