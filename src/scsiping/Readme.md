# NEWS scsiping
This is a utility authored by `kurita@nippon-control-system.co.jp` and reproduced here under the terms of the GNU public license (per `scsi.c` header).

I converted the files to UTF-8 for easier browsing on modern systems, but you can create a tar package of everything in SJIS for use on a NEWS system using the included script, `package_sjis.sh`.

The original location for this [source code](https://web.archive.org/web/20041205045543/http://www.videa.or.jp/NEWS/archive/scsiping-NEWS.tar.gz) is [NEWS World](https://web.archive.org/web/20041205045543/http://www.videa.or.jp/NEWS/nws-soft.html) on the Internet Archive.
