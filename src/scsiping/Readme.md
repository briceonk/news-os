# NEWS scsiping
This is a utility authored by `kurita@nippon-control-system.co.jp` and reproduced here under the terms of the GNU public license (per `scsi.c` header).

I converted the files to UTF-8 for easier browsing on modern systems, but you can create a tar package of everything in SJIS for use on a NEWS system using the included script, `package_sjis.sh`.

See `Readme` (original readme in Japanese) or `Readme-en` (translated to English) for build and usage instructions. I was able to successfully compile and run this program on a Sony NWS-5000X running NEWS-OS 4.2.1aR.

Many thanks to Mr. Kurita from the Nippon Control System corporation for writing such a helpful utility! I wonder if he thought someone would still be using it almost 30 years later...
