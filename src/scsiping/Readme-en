This is a program for Sony NEWS-OS that displays SCSI device information.

It is compatible with NEWS-OS 4.2/4.2.1 and NEWS-OS 6.0.

This program was tested with both NEWS-OS 4.2.1RN and NEWS-OS 6.0 on a 
Sony bigNEWS (NWS-3150) workstation laptop.

It will execute the SCSI commands READ CAPACITY, INQUIRY, and MODE SENSE,
then print the results to stdout.
  
For example, if you execute the following command on NEWS-OS 6, it will print
out the information for devices on SCSI bus 0.
 % scsi /dev/rsd/b0i[0-6]u0p2
 
You can run the following commands to build the program and documentation from
where the Makefile and source files were extracted.
 % make
 # make install
 # make install.man
